# Next.js Blog Tutorial

A static blog built with **Next.js 13**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. This repository is my journey from React to Next.js, learning from beginner-level tutorials and similar GitHub projects.

##  Why I Built This ?

After learning React, I wanted to take dive into Next.js which is based on react. I explored:

- Static site generation with Markdown (.md/.mdx)
- Tailwind-based styling
- Routing and layout with Next.js App Router

##  Features

- SSG-powered blog with Markdown content
- Clean UI styled with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Dynamic post routing via file-based structure
- Fully responsive design
